# Hi there 👋

I'm Allan, a computer science student @ the University of Waterloo, in Canada!

🌱 Interests:

- Rust 🦀 (Learning 😁)
- Building cool products 😎
- Distributed Systems
- Infrasturcture + Cloud
- Machine Learning + Deep Learning

I use this platform to share my school notes, as well as personal notes of the concepts and algorithms I learn and find pretty cool.
