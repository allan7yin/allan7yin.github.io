### Vendors:

- `GET /vendors`
    - Returns list of vendors
- `GET /vendor/{id}`
    - Gets a vendor by `id`
- `POST /vendors`
    - Create a vendor

  

### Member Offers

Vendor can get all offers, and then perhaps query this by something (date made, title, tags, etc.). Then, they can publish these, so each of these offers is created for each of the targeted members (give vendor the option to control who gets to see which offers, will allow the to create a tier for the offers construct).
