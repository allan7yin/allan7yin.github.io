## Oauth2.0 in Spring Boot

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account.

In Spring Boot, OAuth2.0 is implemented through the Spring Security framework. Spring Security OAuth provides support for using OAuth2.0 with Spring Boot applications. With Spring Security OAuth, you can easily set up an OAuth2.0 server to authenticate and authorize access to your application's REST APIs.

To use OAuth2.0 with Spring Boot, you need to add the Spring Security OAuth2.0 dependency to your project. You can then configure the OAuth2.0 server by creating a configuration class that extends the `AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter` class. In this class, you can specify the client details, such as the client ID and secret, and the authorized grant types.

Once you have set up the OAuth2.0 server, you can use Spring Security to secure your application's REST APIs. Spring Security provides support for OAuth2.0 authentication and authorization, enabling you to authenticate users and authorize access to resources based on their roles and permissions.
