Like C++, as TypeScript is also an object-oriented programming language, it has types, specifically:

- Primitive types
- Object types

  

It has the usual:

```TypeScript
string // string 
number // a number
boolean // bool
null // null
undefined // 
symbol // a unique constant value 
```

Object types are functions, arrays, classes, etc. Later, youâ€™ll learn how to create custom object types.

  

There are two main purposes for types in TypeScript:

1. Used by TypeScript compiler to analyze code for errors
2. Allows you to understand what values are associated with which variables

## Summary

- Every value in TypeScript has a type.
- A type is a label that describes the properties and methods that a value has.
- TypeScript compiler uses types to analyze your code for hunting bugs and errors.
