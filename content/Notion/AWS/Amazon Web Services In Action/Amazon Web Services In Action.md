### An Introduction to AWS

What is **AWS**? → In short, AWS is a platform of web services that offers solutions for computing. Why would one want to use AWS? There are a couple of main reasons:

1. Hosting a web server → Instead of a business running its own web server and database with its own data centres, it can use AWS instead, which comes with certain advantages for the cost incurred
2. Implementing a high available system → AWS employs tools such as CDN (Content delivery network) and Load balancers between multiple running instances of the web server. This allows for concurrency but more importantly, reliability. **Murphy’s Law** states: _anything that can go wrong_ **_will_** _go wrong_.
3. One advantage of AWS is that all of its services are available through API calls

Here are some key definitions:

- **High Availability:** refers to the design and implementation of systems, services, or infrastructure. For instance, in a typical setup, a web server hosts a website or web application, and ensuring high availability is essential to minimize downtime and provide a seamless experience for users. This is done through methods such as load balancing, automatic failover, etc.
