### Analysis 4

4a: My ID number is [20949813] and I will be comparing subject.race in San Francisco

4b:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Sample Statistic|Non-White|White|
|Size|286|208|
|Mean|3.523|3.667|
|Median|3.497|3.664|
|Standard Deviation|0.335|0.345|

4c: To test $H_0: \mu_0 = \mu_1$﻿, we use an unpaired test because for this study, it is reasonable to assume the 2 groups (white and non-white) are independent of each other. The observed

value of the test statistic is calculated by

$d = \frac{|\bar{y_1} - \bar{y_2}-0|}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}$

From the above:

- $y_1$﻿: This is the mean for non-white group = value above in table
- $y_2$﻿: This is the mean for white group = value above in table
- $s_p$﻿: This is the pooled standard deviation = 0.339
- $n_1$﻿: This is sample size of non-white group = value above in table
- $n_2$﻿: This is the sample size of white group = value above in table

The value of the test statistic for my sample is -4.678. To calculate the p-value we perform the following computation:

$2(1-P(T \le -4.678))$

Where T is a T-distribution with 286 + 208 - 1 = 493 degrees of freedom. The resulting p-value is 0.00000376.

4d: The results in Analysis 4c rely on the following assumptions:

- The 2 sample groups (white and non-white) are independent of each other
- The above also assumes there is equal variance between the 2 sample groups. In particular, we have assumed that they have the same variance `subject.age`

4e: Based on the results of Analysis 4c, I conclude:

- given the very small p-value, where it is < 0.1, there is compelling evidence arguing against the null hypothesis. Thus, we can say that there is strong evidence that race-based traffic stops exists.
