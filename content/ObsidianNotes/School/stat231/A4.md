### Analysis 1

1a: My ID number is [20949813] and I will analyze data from San Francisco

1b: I will test the null hypothesis $H_0$﻿: $\theta_s = 0.489$﻿

1c: The observed value of the test statistic is 103.392, and the resulting p-value is very close 0.

The p-value was calculated using the chi-squared distribution.

1d: Based on our results from Analysis 1c, I conclude there seems to very strong evidence arguing against the null hypothesis. So, this means there is strong evidence against the statement that approximately 48.9% of San Franciscans identify as female for traffic stops.
