### Analysis 2

2a: My ID number is [20949813] and I will analyze data from San Francisco

2b: To test $H_0$﻿: $\mu = [37.7749]$﻿ we calculate the observed value of the test statistic using:

$\frac{|\bar{y} - \mu_0|}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$

- The `n` is sample size = 494
- The `s` is sample standard deviation = 0.028
- The $\mu_0$﻿ is the hypothesis mean = 37.7749
- The $\bar{y}$﻿ = 37.760

  

The value of the test statistic for my sample is 12.6726. To calculate the p-value, we perform the following calculation:

$2P(T \ge \frac{|\bar{y} - \mu_0|}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}})$

where T is a t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. The p-value generated from this is approximately 0.

2c: Based on the results of analysis 2b, I conclude that observed data is impossible under the null hypothesis. There is very compelling evidence arguing against the claim that all traffic stops in San Francisco occurring near the latitude 37.7749 North on average.
