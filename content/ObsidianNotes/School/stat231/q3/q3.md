### Analysis 3

3a: My ID number is [20949813] and I will analyze data from San Francisco

3b: The least squares estimate of $\alpha$﻿ is 27.784, with 95% confidence interval [18.241, 37.327]. The least squares estimate of $\beta$﻿ is -0.081 with 95% confidence interval [-0.160, -0.004].

3c: The estimate of $\sigma$﻿ is 0.028

3d: In the context of this study, $\alpha$﻿ represents the mean value of the latitude value of traffic stops in San Francisco given that the longitude is 0

3g:

The linear model makes some fundamental assumptions, namely:

- The model assumes $Y_i$﻿ has a Gaussian distribution
- The model assumes that variability of the residuals is constant across all levels of independent variable → in other words, it assumes **homoscedasticity**
- The model assumes that expected value of $Y_i$﻿ is a linear combination of the unknown regression coefficients and known covariates

Under this model, if these assumptions are upheld, we can expect the following:

- For the data to match the linear regression → the points will fit reasonably well with the linear line we plotted in the first scatter plot (represented by the dashed blue line). Evidently, the points do not uphold this assumption.
- In general, under this model, we expect there to be some certain degree of distance between points. That is, they be spread out to a certain extent. Given the sample above (and ignoring the 2 outliers that are seen to the bottom right), the points generally do conform and support this assumption.
- Now, we can analyze the residual scatter plot. The points do look to be spaced out in a random fashion around the horizontal line. In this sample, there is a very large density of points in the middle of swarm, and suggests there is no randomness in the scattering.
- The QQPlot should give us a relatively straight line under this model assumption, which is not the case in the above. This is another instance of the data not supporting the model’s assumptions.

From the above analysis, the linear model does not seem suitable for my sample.

3h: An estimate of the value of lat for a future traffic stop that occurs at a longitude of 100 degrees west is value 35.932, with 95% prediction interval [34.182, 37.681]

3i:

The p-value of a test of $H_0: \beta = 0$﻿ is 0.0405. This was calculated using a T-distribution.

3j: Based on the results of Analysis 3i, I conclude there is compelling evidence against the argument that the latitude of a traffic stop $i$﻿ has a linear relationship with the longitude of traffic stop $i$
