> This course needs us to read the textbook chapters. In order to teach the course concepts, the course teaches this through a “story-like” approach.

This course will focus on the management side of software development processes, instead of specific things like development languages. More specifically, this course will focus on more DevOps related concepts and methodologies.

**⇒ Key Terms**

- **Business:** An economic entity that transforms a set of inputs, such as materials and labour into an output that has value to a customer
- **Business Process:** A sequence of activities within an organization which are performed to achieve an organizational goal
- **Customer:** A customer can be thought of as an entity that perceives value in your product or service and is willing to make an economic exchange to attain it
- **Information Technologies:** The hardware and software related to the management and analysis of data and information
- **Supply-chain:** A sequence of entities which provide the inputs to the next stage in the chain, ultimately resulting in a product or service being provided to an end user
- **Value:** This is the amount of benefit perceived by a user of a product or service and is (in theory) reflected in the price that the customer is willing to pay for it

**Key Takeaways:**

- It is important for developers to have business knowledge
- Having an understanding of the intent of the software can help developers have an over-arching view of what needs to be done, and how to implement

  

## 1b) Businesses Processes

Lets first examine the concept of business processes and how they relate to the information infrastructure of a firm.

**⇒ What is a business?**

- A business is an organization which exists for the purpose of creating products or providing services.
- Becomes sustainable by producing a profit that exceeds the costs associated with creating and delivering the product or service
- **Input**: People’s time and materials, **output**: product

- **Inbound Logistics:** activities related to the acquisition of the inputs necessary to deliver the product or service.
- Materials then moved into **Operations**, transformed into something of value to customers
- Then moved out to customers through **Outbound Logistics**
- **Marketing** make customers aware of the product, and **Sales** is concerned the the exchange of the product for economic value
- Last is **Service,** which may be present at many points in the product’s lifetime (fixes, etc.)

> **Example Scenario:  
>   
> **Manufacturing company that makes bread:

- the inbound logistics is the management of all the input ingredients needed to make the products.
- Operations would be the mixing and baking of the ingredients to create loaves of bread
- outbound logistics would be the function of shipping the finished bread to local stores.
- Marketing and sales in this case would be activities to let the public know about the bread that is being sold and sales deals with the payment from the stores who plan to resell the bread they buy.
- Service in this case may be minimal, but would be responsible for managing issues that may arise, such as quality problems or late deliveries, with the stores who are customers.

  

**⇒ Support Activities**

These are activities which are critical to the successful operation of the enterprise, but which may not directly impact the creation of value to the customer.

  

**⇒ Supply Chains**

## 1c) Businesses Processes

IT is used differently in different firms. It is easy to imagine that the IT requirements of a manufacturing firm will be different from those of an accounting or law firm. In this discussion, we will consider a manufacturing oriented company. Below, we’ll examine the ways IT functions as a support for the primary activities.

  

### Primary Activities

**⇒ Inbound Logistics**

IT can required for:

- Software related to inventory tracking
- Supply management systems - can be part of local organization, or perhaps a larger system

**⇒ Operations**

- Wide range of applications: Materials Requirements Planning, which is used in manufacturing, maintenance management systems, workforce management, production scheduling systems and inventory management.
    - In general, a lot of these operations will need some sort of IT to facilitate

**⇒ Outbound Logistics**

- Outbound logistics will need IT support in terms of inventory / warehouse management and interfacing to supply chain management systems
- Shipping systems, tracking, interacting/managing 3rd party shipment services

**⇒ Marketing and Sales**

- The most “customer-facing” part of the business.
- From an IT perspective, this involves a range of tools from Business Intelligence/Data Analytics to Customer Relationship Management systems such as SalesForce.
- Social media, web content, e-commerce

**⇒ Service**

- IT support is the part of the firm that typically focuses on providing rapid response and personalization as much as possible.

  

### Support Activities

**⇒ Procurement**

This is the organization function of acquiring all the materials needed for the firm’s operation, in terms of both the primary and support functions. This can include IT support for such things as supplier, order and inventory management.

**⇒ Technology**

Broad, capture all organizational support activities related to design and creation of new products or improvements to existing products or improvements to existing products or systems.

**⇒ Human Resources Management**

We often think of Human Resources (HR) as the part of the organization which manages the hiring and firing of employees. As such it has IT support requirements for employee management, in the form of employee databases, and related document management.

**⇒ Finance**

This part of the organization is responsible for the management of money. This encompasses accounts payable (money owed by the firm), accounts receivable (money owed to the firm), tracking budgets, tax payments, cash-flow management etc.

**⇒ Firm Infrastructure**

This is a ‘catch all’ for all those corporate functions not covered in the previous sections. This may include such things as the telephone and communications infrastructure, facilities maintenance and associated work order management. As with the other areas of the firm, this can require various types of IT support.
