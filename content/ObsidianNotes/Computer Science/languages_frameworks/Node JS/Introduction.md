This document will serve as a brief introduction to NodeJs. So, what is it? Conventionally, we know that JavaScript is a language that cannot be run on a local machine, unlike something like C++ or Java. However, to make it so that we can use it in back-end applications, we can use NodeJs, or things built off of it like NestJs.

  

So, how does it run JavaScript code? It uses a JavaScript engine, just like what Google Chrome uses. With a V8 engine, it does what chrome does: Send the JavaScript code to the engine, and returns the results.
